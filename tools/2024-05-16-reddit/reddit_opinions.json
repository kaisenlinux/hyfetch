They would have said that it's compulsive and self destructive and tons of other negative things. Hypersexuality is most harmful because acting out the needs you have is met with hostility by society. If you're a woman with an extremely high libido who seeks out multiple partners, more than what is \"normal\", you're seen as damaged goods and crazy. If you were hypersexual in a society that actually accepted sexuality and its needs, it wouldn't be nearly as bad as it can be now. And no, hs isn't just \"high libido\", it's more complicated than that, but like other identities it's something you can't change and which is made the worst in the experience by a puritan society that sees sexuality as suspicious.",

You CAN change it! That's why people go into therapy and get medicated for. Like what are you even talking about. By telling people they can't change it you're trying to move them away from seeking help, why would you do that just to pretend like hs is a harmless personality quirk",

There's no cure for being hypersexual, just as there isn't any cure for any sexuality. You can try and shove it down into silence with drugs and psychological methods, but that doesn't mean it's gone. It's pretty icky to me that you're like \"nooo you can't have a different perspective you must be pretending to be hs!\" I'd tell you about my own personal history and experiences and why I 100% know what I'm talking about, but not gonna divulge that in public. The harm that is caused by those compulsive feelings is very correlated to what society thinks and how it reacts to our actions. If you have an overwhelming compulsion to go out and do things that explicitly harm you, like puts your physical safety at serious risk, that's not just hypersexuality, that's hypersexuality plus something else, and mostly something else.",

    "content": "No amount of therapy or medication will stop you from being gay And no amount of therapy or medication will stop you from being hypersexual either. All it will do is dull you, it can't carve out a part of who you are. Drugs can tranquilize anyone down to the point where they are too numb to even feel, or they can impose themselves to disrupt your endocrine system, but at the end of the day, you are still you. With the drugs, now you're just buried beneath them. You're being very inconsiderate and rude with the implication that I \"want hs to be the same as being gay\". You know that's a disingenuous thing to say, because you know what I've been trying to say here and I am far from the first gal to say it. What makes hypersexuality so much worse is the same thing that has made other marginalized sexualities, such as being gay, much worse, which is our inheritance of a fundamentalist Christian world which viewed anything sexual as sinful and \"against God\". Barely 100 years ago, women were diagnosed (yes, literally clinically diagnosed by doctors and other professionals) as having being mentally ill with what they called \"hysteria\" because they had sexual desires or were inclined towards promiscuity. Women were and still are socially ostracized and mocked and bullied for the same thing still to this day. Note how that happened only to women, never to men. I really hope you do read this, and not just skim it so you can argue on the internet, because I think there's a good chance you've internalized the same fundamentalist religious and patriarchal viewpoints as I've just been describing. Sexuality is not a sickness. Being constantly horny is not a sickness. The only way it becomes a sickness is if you have strong compulsions to do things that put you in harms way, and you don't need hypersexuality to get you there either.",

There's medication that can help you without making you a zombie. I'd say look it up but since you will write off any modern medicine because 100 years ago they gave you coke for headaches ... what is the point? Also nice accusing me of being disingenuous and then writing everything I say off as just trying to win an online argument. I can tell you're super interested in a real conversation. Im happy that you cant fathom that hs comes with real mental problems that are not caused by society and will not be fixed by society. But hs is not equal to high libido and everything you said is just about people being judged for sleeping around a lot. Its just not what hs means. I can't link you the definition because you will just write it off so idk what else there is to talk about. I just think its disgusting to come to a hs support space and discourage people from seeking help by painting the available treatment as negative as you do and gaslighting people that all their issues are from society and that they shouldn't work to fix them.",

Could've been nice to actually talk about this, but you didn't even address what I said at all about how society has made life shit for women and their sexuality both historically and contemporarily, which is actually a pretty important point that you should pay attention to, so idk ig there's just no way of getting through to you and having an actual conversation. I said many times that hs is not just high libido. Ik this, because I'm hs. All you do is assume and put words in my mouth. Ik the definition. No, I don't write off modern medicine. I'm a trans woman with over 4 years on HRT, trust me I love modern medicine lol.
